## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess health data for machine learning
- Explore distributions and detect outliers via EDA
- Build and evaluate a **K-Nearest Neighbors classifier**
- Analyze classification metrics for model interpretation
- Demonstrate machine learning's role in health risk assessment

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset includes medical and personal information for heart disease classification:

- 👤 Age, Sex  
- 🩺 Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Max Heart Rate  
- ⚕️ Chest Pain Type, Exercise-Induced Angina, ST Depression  
- 🎯 Target Variable: `HeartDisease` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## 🔍 Key Highlights of the Analysis

### ✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Checked for nulls, incorrect types, and value ranges
- Handled missing values (if any)
- Applied `StandardScaler` to normalize continuous variables for KNN

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualized numeric distributions: Age, RestingBP, Cholesterol, MaxHR
- Created countplots for categorical features: `Sex`, `ChestPainType`, `HeartDisease`
- Used boxplots to detect outliers and understand data spread

### 🤖 Model Building with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- Split data (80% training, 20% testing)
- Implemented `KNeighborsClassifier` using Scikit-learn
- Performed basic hyperparameter tuning (K-value selection)
- Used distance-based voting to classify heart disease risk

### 📈 Model Evaluation

- Classification Report: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Compared performance on training vs. test set
- Reviewed confusion matrix for understanding classification balance

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – data manipulation
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – visualization
  - `scikit-learn` – machine learning & model evaluation
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for step-by-step analysis and narrative
